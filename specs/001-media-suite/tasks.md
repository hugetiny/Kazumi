# Tasks: Kazumi Media Experience Suite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-media-suite/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Principle V requires acceptance evidence. Add automated `flutter test` coverage or document the manual playback matrices noted in quickstart.md for each story‚Äôs acceptance criteria.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each slice is independently implementable and testable.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Task can be executed in parallel (different files, no blocking dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Maps task to user story (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include concrete file paths in every task description

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish toolchain and scaffolding required by later phases.

- [x] T001 Run `flutter pub get` from project root `.`
- [x] T002 Execute `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` from `.`
- [x] T003 [P] Configure `slang.yaml` so Simplified Chinese is default and planned locales align with media suite scope
- [x] T004 [P] Update `specs/001-media-suite/quickstart.md` prerequisites to reflect Bangumi/TMDb credential setup and aria2 daemon instructions

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Shared infrastructure that every user story depends on.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 ‚Äì Discover Official Metadata (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enrich catalogue entries with Bangumi/TMDb metadata using locale-aware precedence and user toggles.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2** ‚Üí User stories in priority order (US1 P1 ‚Üí US2 P2 ‚Üí US4 P2 ‚Üí US3 P3) ‚Üí **Polish**
- User stories can begin only after Phase 2 completes; afterwards they may proceed sequentially or in parallel if ownership is clear.
- Within each story, complete tests before implementation tasks to honor acceptance criteria.

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Setup: T003 and T004 can progress while T001‚ÄìT002 run.
- Foundational: T006‚ÄìT009 are marked [P]; distribute across owners once Hive updates (T005) land.
- US1: T010 and T011 can execute concurrently; T016‚ÄìT018 depend on earlier modeling tasks.
- US2: T020 and T021 proceed in parallel; T027 can be isolated once storage overrides from T006 exist.
- US4: T028 unblocks while T029‚ÄìT033 evolve; UI (T032) waits for ingestion logic (T029).
- US3: T034 may start after T035 scaffolds models; T037 and T039 can run in parallel once controller (T036) is ready.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Complete Phases 1‚Äì2 to solidify shared infrastructure.
2. Deliver User Story 1 as the MVP and validate via T010‚ÄìT019.
3. Layer User Story 2‚Äôs playback enhancements while maintaining independence.
4. Implement User Story 4 to unlock torrent ingestion, reusing aria2 foundations.
5. Finish with User Story 3 to unify downloads with the library.
6. Close with Polish tasks to document, verify, and harden the release.
