# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently

  Constitution alignment:
  - Capture privacy impacts (new storage boxes, retention changes, consent flows).
  - Note plugin validation strategy (sample selectors, fixture recordings, `Request` usage).
  - Specify playback verification across Windows + Android when UX changes or shaders are involved.
  - Identify platform-specific behaviour and feature flags required for parity.

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- How does the feature behave when a plugin response is empty, malformed, or violates `Api.apiLevel`?
- What happens when media-kit fails to initialize (e.g., missing shaders, codec unavailable)?
- How is user privacy preserved if sync or external player targets are unreachable?
- What fallback occurs on unsupported platforms (desktop vs. mobile)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Feature MUST run all network requests through `Request` and respect global proxy headers.
- **FR-002**: Feature MUST document storage impacts (Hive boxes, retention window) and migrations in `GStorage`.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST retain seamless playback; new flows provide guarded fallbacks when dependencies fail.
- **FR-004**: Feature MUST ship plugin fixtures or validation steps covering selectors, pagination, and playback roads.
- **FR-005**: Feature MUST enumerate platform support (Windows, Android, others) and guard platform-specific behaviour with runtime checks.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Feature MUST confirm consent requirements for sync/export flows [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user acknowledgement path not provided]
- **FR-007**: Feature MUST define shader/media resource handling [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: fallback strategy missing]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
